The raw training data is stored in the lingspam_public folder.

The instances represent every single email stored as a .txt.

We account for the labels spam/not_spam as we called them.
Each instance is classified with exactly one label by the title.
As in the official readme file it is stated that the spam emails have the prefix spm in the title.

The attributes represent all the words found in at least one of the emails.

We used the nltk module for tokenizing the words and to filter the stop words in the emails.
After that we reduced all the words possible to their base form using the WordNetLemmatizer function from the nltk module,
and filter the punctuation signs and other unwanted char

We stored all the processed data in a new folder with a similar structure.
